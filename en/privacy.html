        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>KineticMCP ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
            and handle your data when you use our software and website.</p>

        <h3>2. Data Collection & Self-Hosting</h3>
        <p><strong>KineticMCP is a self-hosted software.</strong> This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do <strong>not</strong> have access to the data you process through your KineticMCP instance.</li>
            <li>Your Salesforce credentials, data, and API keys remain on your infrastructure.</li>
            <li>We do not collect telemetry or usage data from your self-hosted instances unless explicitly opted-in
                (currently no such feature exists).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Website Data</h3>
        <p>When you visit <code>kineticmcp.github.io</code>, we may use standard analytics tools (like Google Analytics)
            to understand visitor traffic. This data is aggregated and anonymized.</p>

        <h3>4. Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>KineticMCP facilitates connection between your data and AI providers (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI). <strong>We
                are not an AI provider.</strong> Your data is sent directly from your infrastructure to the AI provider
            you configure. You are responsible for complying with their data policies.</p>
